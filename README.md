# Express.c

Simple program in C that implements functions executions queue.

- The important point in this project is that I used doxygen to generate docs.

## Build

Use the `makefile` to build the binary and the docs.

```shell
make run # build and run the binary
make build # just build the binary
make docs # generates the docs using doxygen
make clear # removes everything
```
